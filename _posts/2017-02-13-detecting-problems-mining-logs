##Detecting Large-Scale System Problems by Mining Console Logs
Wei Xu. PhD dissertation. UC Berkeley.

Console logs contain large amounts of free text data. System source code is a schema for the console log text. 
Features are obtained from system state variables and message identifiers. Principal Component Analysis is 
used to learn the normal pattern (first few principal components). Any system event far away from this normal pattern 
is flagged as an anomaly.

Here is an image that gives intuition for using PCA:
