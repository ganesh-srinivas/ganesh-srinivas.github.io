 <h1>Ganesh Srinivas</h1>
 <!--<p>A place where such vulgar and depraved things as careerism, money and public opinion are not welcome. A place where I can fall in love with beauty again, and shed the poor armor of ambition.</p>

 <h3>Reading list</h3>
 <blockquote>“The writer Umberto Eco belongs to that small class of scholars who are encyclopedic, insightful, and nondull. He is the owner of a large personal library (containing thirty thousand books), and separates visitors into two categories: those who react with “Wow! Signore, professore dottore Eco, what a library you have ! How many of these books have you read?” and the others - a very small minority - who get the point that a private library is not an ego-boosting appendage but a research tool. Read books are far less valuable than unread ones. The library should contain as much of what you don’t know as your financial means, mortgage rates and the currently tight real-estate market allows you to put there. You will accumulate more knowledge and more books as you grow older, and the growing number of unread books on the shelves will look at you menancingly. Indeed, the more you know, the larger the rows of unread books. Let us call this collection of unread books an antilibrary.”</blockquote>
 <p>I read a <em>lot</em>. When I get time, here are some of the books I'd like to mention.</p> 
 <ul>
  <li>The Bhagavad Gita. Translation by <a href="notebook/gita-mascaro.html">Juan Mascaro</a>.</li>
  <li>The Bhagavad Gita. Translation by S. Radhakrishnan.</li>
  <li>The Opposing Shore. By Julien Gracq. Translation of <em>Le rivage des Syrtes</em>. Simply fabulous!</li>
  <li>The Tartar Steppe. By Dino Buzatti. Translation of <em>Il deserto dei tartari</em>.</li>
  <li>Antifragile. By my intellectual hero: Nassim Nicholas Taleb. He has shaped a signficant part of my outlook: aesthetic and moral. This book has supplied me with so many ideas, anecdotes and opinions for contemplation and discussion.</li>
  <li>The Little Prince. By Antoine de Saint-Exupery.</li>
  <li>The Old Man and the Sea. Ernest Hemingway. Short story.</li>
 </ul>

 <p><em>28 March 2016</em><strong>Should I include material from computer science here?</strong> It disturbs me that most of the people who've studied computer science, the discipline for <a href="">efficient implementation of automated abstractions</a> don't seem to be doing the things that have much impact on the world or significantly ease their life. The second failure appalls me much more than the first. Despite all this, I still retain some hope that a university education in computer science and engineering, is the best likelihood of attaining such knowledge.</p>
