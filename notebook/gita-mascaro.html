 <h2>The Bhagavad Gita</h2>
 <p>Most recently, I read Juan Mascaro's translation of the Gita more than three <a href="times.html">times</a>. It is very short - 80 pages. Only translation, no original Sanskrit text, no transliteration, and no commentary.</p>
 <p>Sunday, 26 March 2016: It took me four hours to finish the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna. That is a long and dense conversation!</p>

 <p>He who offers to me with devotion only a leaf, or a flower, or a fruit, or even a little water, this I accept from the yearning soul, because with a pure heart it was offered with love.</p>
