 <h2>The Bhagavad Gita - Translation by Juan Mascaro</h2>
 <p>I've read this translation more than three <a href="notebook/times.html">times</a>. It is very short - 80 pages. Only translation, no original Sanskrit text, no transliteration, and no commentary.</p>
 <p>Sunday, 26 March 2016: It took me four hours to finish the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna. That is a long and dense conversation!</p>
