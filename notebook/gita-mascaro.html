 <h2>The Bhagavad Gita</h2>
 <p>Most recently, I read Juan Mascaro's translation of the Gita more than three <a href="times.html">times</a>. It is very short - 80 pages. Only translation, no original Sanskrit text, no transliteration, and no commentary.</p>
 <p>Sunday, 26 March 2016: It took me four hours to finish the conversation between Arjuna and Krishna. That is a long and dense conversation!</p>
 <h3>Snippets</h3>
 <p>I really like this passage from Mascaro's Introduction:</p>
 <p>The greatness of the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> is the greatness of the universe; but even as the wonder of the stars in heaven only reveals itself in the silence of the night, the wonder of this poem only reveals itself in the silence of the soul. We may begin when children to feel the mystery and wonder of this universe. One day, when very young, a few verses of the <em>Gita</em> may find their way into our hearts. We learn Sanskrit for the sake of the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em>. We read every translation we can find and compare different interpretations. We read the commentaries of Sankara and Ramanuja, histories of Indian philosophy and Sanskrit literature, and every publication on the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> we can find. And far more than that: we may read the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> in Sanskrit again and again, until we know the most important verses by heart, and chant them in Sanskrit, and the language of those verses becomes as familiar to us as our mother tongue. We may go to that poem in times of sorrow and joy and thus connect it with the deepest moments of our life; and write down the thoughts and emotions that the verses wake in us; and our reading may go on for years; and suddenly one day we may feel that we are reading the <em>Bhagavad Gita</em> for the first time. And why? Because new wonders have revealed themselves to us and we feel that the words of Arjuna are our own words: 'Speak to me again of thy power and thy glory, for I am never tired, never, of hearing thy words of life' 10.18.</p>
 <p><em>9.26</em></p>
 <p>He who offers to me with devotion only a leaf, or a flower, or a fruit, or even a little water, this I accept from the yearning soul, because with a pure heart it was offered with love.</p>
