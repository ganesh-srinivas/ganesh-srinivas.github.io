  <h1>Ganesh Srinivas</h1>
  <p>Hi! I am a software engineer at Viasat. I am also enrolled in the Georgia Tech Online MS in Computer Science program. In May 2017, I graduated from Shiv Nadar University, Greater Noida with a BTech degree in Computer Science and Engineering degree. I live in Chennai, India.</p>
  <h3>MS Coursework</h3>
  <p>The OMSCS degree program is demanding. It is a challenge to balance studies and a full-time job though!</p>
